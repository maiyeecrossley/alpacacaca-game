This is the README for my **Alpacacaca** game.

## Description

![Alpcacaca]
Alpacacaca is a game that takes on the original 1981 Frogger arcade game.
The idea of the game is to guide the alpaca to the top of the flowery field, crossing over the river of logs, and avoiding the herd of cows on the field.

## Build Process


### Challenges
When deploying the alpaca.gif onto CSS, the image would load over the background layers of my grass and water tiles, however, it contained a solid white background instead of being transparent, despite the gif file already having the transparent background.
